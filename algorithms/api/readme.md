# Air Pollution Data Fetching Script using OpenWeatherMap API

This script fetches air pollution data for a specific location (New Delhi, India) using the OpenWeatherMap API. It retrieves key pollution components and the Air Quality Index (AQI).

## Libraries Used

```python
import requests
import json
```

- **requests**: A popular Python library used to send HTTP requests (like GET, POST). Here, it's used to fetch data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **json**: A library used to parse and manipulate JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data. It helps convert API responses into a Python-readable format.

## Function: `get_pollution_data()`

```python
def get_pollution_data():
    api_key = 'API-key'
    lat = 28.6139
    lon = 77.2089
    url = fr"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/air_pollution?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={api_key}"

    response = requests.get(url)
```

### Breakdown:

- **API Key**: The `api_key` variable holds the API key necessary to access OpenWeatherMap services. Replace `'API-key'` with your actual API key.
- **Latitude (`lat`) and Longitude (`lon`)**: These variables define the geographical coordinates for which pollution data is fetched. In this case, the coordinates are for New Delhi, India.
- **API URL**: The API endpoint is constructed using the coordinates and the API key. The f-string (`fr`) allows embedding the `lat`, `lon`, and `api_key` into the URL dynamically.
- **HTTP GET Request**: The `requests.get(url)` function sends a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API using the constructed URL and retrieves the air pollution data.

### Handling the Response

```python
    # Check if the request was successful
    if response.status_code == 200:
        # Parse the JSON response
        data = response.json()

        # Extract pollution stats
        pollution_info = data['list'][0]['components']  # Get the pollution components
        aqi = data['list'][0]['main']['aqi']  # Get the Air Quality Index (AQI)

        print(f"Pollution stats for New Delhi (lat: {lat}, lon: {lon}):")
        print(json.dumps(pollution_info, indent=4))  # Pretty print the pollution data
        print(f"AQI: {aqi}")

        return pollution_info
    else:
        print(f"Failed to fetch data: {response.status_code}")
```

- **Status Code Check**: 
  - The **status code** of the response is checked to ensure the request was successful (HTTP 200). If the status code is 200, the script proceeds to parse the response.
  - **response.json()**: Converts the JSON response from the API into a Python dictionary for further processing.

- **Extract Pollution Stats**:
  - The `pollution_info` is extracted from the `list[0]['components']` of the returned JSON. This key contains the actual pollutant concentrations like CO (carbon monoxide), NO (nitric oxide), NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), etc.
  - The AQI value is extracted from the `list[0]['main']['aqi']` key, which gives an Air Quality Index value for the specified location.

- **Pretty Print**: The `json.dumps()` function is used to neatly format and print the pollution information with an indentation level of 4 spaces.

- **Return**: The function returns the `pollution_info` dictionary containing the various pollution components if the request is successful.

- **Error Handling**: If the request fails (status code not 200), an error message is printed showing the HTTP status code.

## Example Output:

If the request is successful, the console output would look like:

```plaintext
Pollution stats for New Delhi (lat: 28.6139, lon: 77.2089):
{
    "co": 215.96,
    "no": 0.01,
    "no2": 0.02,
    "o3": 61.23,
    "so2": 0.03,
    "pm2_5": 18.24,
    "pm10": 25.76,
    "nh3": 0.32
}
AQI: 2
```

The returned `pollution_info` dictionary would contain the concentrations of different pollutants like CO (carbon monoxide), NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), PM2.5 (particulate matter), etc. The AQI value will be a number indicating the air quality, where a lower AQI indicates better air quality.

## How to Use

1. Replace `'API-key'` with your OpenWeatherMap API key.
2. Run the script, and it will fetch and display pollution stats for New Delhi, India.
```

## Conclusion

This script demonstrates how to use the **OpenWeatherMap API** to fetch pollution data for a specified location. It uses **requests** to make HTTP requests and **json** to handle the response data. The key information extracted includes concentrations of pollutants like CO, NO, and PM2.5, and the overall AQI for the location.
