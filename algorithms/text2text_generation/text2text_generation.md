# Text Generation with Transformers Models

This document provides explanations for four different text generation methods using various models from the Hugging Face **Transformers** library. Each method uses a different approach and model architecture for generating text from a given prompt.

## 1. Text Generation using Google FLAN-T5-Large

This method uses the **FLAN-T5-Large** model from Google for conditional text generation. The model is designed to handle various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including text generation.

```python
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration

def generate_text__google_flan_t5_large(prompt: str):
    # Step 1: Load the tokenizer and model
    model_name = "google/flan-t5-large"
    tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
    model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_name)

    # Tokenize the input prompt and prepare input for the model
    inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")

    # Generate text using the model
    output_sequences = model.generate(
        inputs.input_ids,
        max_length=1000,  # Maximum length of generated text
        num_return_sequences=1,  # Number of sequences to generate
        no_repeat_ngram_size=2,  # Avoid repeating n-grams
        num_beams=15,  # Beam search for better results
        temperature=0.2,  # Adjust temperature for randomness (lower is less random)
        top_p=0.9,  # Top-p (nucleus) sampling for diversity
        early_stopping=False  # Generate text until max_length is reached
    )

    # Decode the generated text
    generated_text = tokenizer.decode(output_sequences[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

    return generated_text
```

### Model: **FLAN-T5-Large**
- **FLAN-T5** is part of Google's **FLAN (Fine-tuned Language Net)** family, which focuses on fine-tuning pre-trained models on diverse tasks using instruction-based prompts.
- **T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)**: This model treats every NLP task as a text-to-text problem. In this case, the model generates text conditioned on the input prompt.
- **Beam Search** and **Nucleus Sampling** are used to generate coherent and diverse outputs, while parameters like `temperature` control randomness.

## 2. Text Generation using GPT-2 (Non-fine-tuned)

This method uses the **GPT-2** model for text generation. GPT-2 is a large-scale transformer-based language model designed by OpenAI.

```python
from transformers import pipeline, set_seed

def generate_text__gpt2_base_non_fine_tuned(prompt, model_name='gpt2', seed=42, max_length=200, num_return_sequences=5):
    # Load text generation pipeline and set random seed
    generator = pipeline('text-generation', model=model_name, pad_token_id=50256)
    set_seed(seed)

    # Generate text based on the prompt
    outputs = generator(prompt, max_length=max_length, num_return_sequences=num_return_sequences, truncation=True)

    # Extract and return the generated text from the output dictionaries
    generated_texts = [output['generated_text'] for output in outputs]

    return " ".join(generated_texts)
```

### Model: **GPT-2**
- **GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2)** is an unsupervised transformer model trained on a large corpus of text. It is known for its ability to generate coherent and relevant text, given an input prompt.
- **Pipeline**: The text-generation pipeline simplifies the model usage, providing easy-to-use functionalities for generating text.
- **Random Seed**: Setting the seed ensures reproducibility of the generated text.
- **Truncation** ensures that the generated output does not exceed a certain length.

## 3. Text Generation using Intel DistilGPT-2 (Fine-tuned on WikiText2)

This method uses a **DistilGPT-2** model that has been fine-tuned on the **WikiText2** dataset, optimized for lightweight text generation.

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

def generate_text__intel_distilgpt2_wikitext2(input_text, max_length=50, num_return_sequences=1):
    model_directory = r"<path_to_saved_model>"

    # Load the tokenizer and model from the saved directory
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_directory)
    model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_directory)

    # Encode the input text
    input_ids = tokenizer.encode(input_text, return_tensors="pt")

    # Generate output from the model
    outputs = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=max_length, num_return_sequences=num_return_sequences)

    # Decode and print the generated text
    generated_text = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

    return generated_text
```

### Model: **DistilGPT-2**
- **DistilGPT-2** is a distilled version of GPT-2 that retains most of GPT-2's performance while being faster and lighter in terms of computational resources.
- **Fine-tuning on WikiText2**: This model has been specifically trained on the WikiText2 dataset, making it more specialized for generating text related to factual knowledge.
- The model outputs shorter texts, with the `max_length` limiting the number of tokens generated in the sequence.

## 4. Text Generation using Intel Neural Chat 7B

This method uses **Intel's Neural Chat 7B** model to generate conversational responses, simulating a system that interacts with a user based on the provided inputs.

```python
import transformers
import torch

# Load the model and tokenizer once, outside the function
model_name = 'Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-3'
model = transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

def generate_response(system_input, user_input):
    # Format the input prompt
    prompt = f"### System:\n{system_input}\n### User:\n{user_input}\n### Assistant:\n"

    # Tokenize the prompt
    inputs = tokenizer.encode(prompt, return_tensors="pt", add_special_tokens=False)

    # Generate response with no gradient calculation (faster inference)
    with torch.no_grad():
        outputs = model.generate(inputs, max_new_tokens=200, num_return_sequences=1, early_stopping=True)

    # Decode and return the response
    response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    return response.split("### Assistant:\n")[-1]
```

### Model: **Intel Neural Chat 7B**
- **Neural Chat 7B** is a large conversational model designed to generate text as dialogues. It is pre-trained and fine-tuned on datasets specific to chat-like interactions.
- **Causal Language Model (CLM)**: The model generates responses based on the causal relationship between tokens in the prompt, making it effective for tasks involving dialogue generation or interactive systems.

## Conclusion

Each of these models serves a different purpose within the text generation domain:
1. **FLAN-T5-Large**: Conditional text generation with instruction-based prompts.
2. **GPT-2**: General-purpose text generation from a large pre-trained transformer model.
3. **DistilGPT-2**: Lightweight text generation, fine-tuned for specific domains.
4. **Neural Chat 7B**: A conversational model designed for generating human-like dialogue.
