# Air Quality Prediction Models

This repository contains several machine learning models developed for predicting air pollution levels, particularly focusing on PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations. These models have been trained using various regression techniques and saved as serialized `.pkl` files for easy reuse. The main models and their respective methodologies are outlined below.

### 1. Random Forest Regression

**Random Forest Regression** is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees during training. The predictions are made by averaging the predictions of the individual trees, making it less prone to overfitting than single decision trees.

- **Advantages:**
  - Handles high-dimensional spaces efficiently.
  - Reduces overfitting compared to Decision Tree models.
  - Works well with missing data and maintains accuracy even with a substantial portion of the data missing.

- **Use Case:** Suitable for predicting complex, non-linear patterns in PM2.5 and PM10 datasets.

### 2. Decision Tree Regression

**Decision Tree Regression** is a non-parametric supervised learning method. It splits the data into subsets based on the feature that results in the largest information gain. It is intuitive and easy to understand, but prone to overfitting if not properly regularized.

- **Advantages:**
  - Easy to interpret and visualize.
  - Can handle both categorical and continuous variables.
  - Requires little data preparation (no need to normalize or scale the data).

- **Disadvantages:**
  - Can easily overfit, especially with deep trees.
  - Sensitive to small changes in the data.

- **Use Case:** Provides an interpretable model for PM2.5 and PM10 concentration prediction.

### 3. Gradient Boosting Regression

**Gradient Boosting Regression** is another ensemble technique that builds models sequentially. Each new model is designed to correct the errors of the previous ones. By minimizing a loss function, it iteratively improves prediction accuracy, making it a powerful tool for complex datasets.

- **Advantages:**
  - High predictive accuracy.
  - Flexibility in handling different types of loss functions.
  - Works well with mixed data types (numerical and categorical).

- **Disadvantages:**
  - Prone to overfitting if not properly tuned.
  - More computationally expensive compared to simpler models like linear regression.

- **Use Case:** Ideal for capturing complex relationships in air quality data, especially for non-linear patterns in PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations.

### 4. Linear Regression

**Linear Regression** is a simple yet powerful method for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more input features. It assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable.

- **Advantages:**
  - Simple to implement and interpret.
  - Computationally efficient, even for large datasets.
  - Works well with linearly separable data.

- **Disadvantages:**
  - Assumes linear relationships between features and the target variable.
  - Sensitive to outliers.

- **Use Case:** Suitable for initial baseline models or when a linear relationship between features and PM2.5/PM10 levels is assumed.

### 5. Neural Network Regression (MLP)

**Neural Network Regression** (specifically Multi-Layer Perceptron or MLP) is a form of deep learning where multiple layers of neurons process data in a manner inspired by the human brain. It can capture highly complex and non-linear relationships in the data.

- **Advantages:**
  - Capable of learning complex and highly non-linear relationships.
  - Can generalize well when trained with sufficient data.

- **Disadvantages:**
  - Requires a large amount of data for optimal performance.
  - Computationally expensive and difficult to interpret.

- **Use Case:** Best suited for capturing complex relationships in PM2.5 data, where simple models might fail.

### 6. Support Vector Regression (SVR)

**Support Vector Regression (SVR)** uses support vector machines (SVMs) for regression tasks. It attempts to find a function that deviates from actual target values by a value no greater than epsilon, while simultaneously trying to be as flat as possible.

- **Advantages:**
  - Effective in high-dimensional spaces.
  - Works well when the number of features is larger than the number of samples.
  - Uses kernel trick for non-linear data, making it powerful for capturing non-linear relationships.

- **Disadvantages:**
  - Computationally expensive, especially for large datasets.
  - Sensitive to hyperparameters, which can make tuning difficult.

- **Use Case:** Useful for predicting PM2.5 and PM10 levels when the relationship between features is non-linear.

### 7. Scaler and Data Preprocessing

**Scaler (`scaler.pkl`)** refers to the preprocessing step where the input features are normalized or standardized. Standardization scales the data so that it has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one, which helps improve model performance, especially for models like Neural Networks and SVR.

- **Importance:**
  - Ensures that all features contribute equally to the model.
  - Improves the convergence speed of gradient-based optimization algorithms.
  - Necessary for models that are sensitive to feature scaling (e.g., Neural Networks, SVR).

## Usage Instructions

Each model is saved as a `.pkl` file and can be loaded using the `pickle` library in Python. To make predictions using these models, ensure the input data is preprocessed (e.g., scaled) similarly to the training data.
