# Code Explanation for LlamaAPI and Transformers-based Summarization Models

This document contains explanations for three different summarization methods: one using the **LlamaAPI** and two using the **Transformers** library by Hugging Face. Each method helps in generating summaries from given text prompts.

## 1. Summarization using LlamaAPI

This method uses the **LlamaAPI** to summarize reviews or text prompts into a single unbiased paragraph.

```python
import json
from llamaapi import LlamaAPI

def summarize_llama_api(prompt):
    print("inside MODEL, prompt: ", prompt)
    # Initialize the SDK
    llama = LlamaAPI("API-Key")

    initial_prompt = "You are a review summarizer. Summarize the following review(s) into one single paragraph: DO NOT BE BIASED"
    prompt = initial_prompt + prompt

    # Build the API request
    api_request_json = {
        "messages": [
            {"role": "user", "content": f"{prompt}"},
        ],
        "stream": False,
        "function_call": "get_current_weather",
    }

    # Execute the Request
    response = llama.run(api_request_json)
    response = response.json()

    content = response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
    print(content)

    return content
```

### Breakdown:
- **LlamaAPI Initialization**: 
  - The `LlamaAPI` object is initialized with an API key (`"API-Key"`), which should be replaced with your actual API key.
  
- **Prompt Construction**:
  - A base prompt is defined: `"You are a review summarizer. Summarize the following review(s) into one single paragraph: DO NOT BE BIASED"`. The user-provided `prompt` is concatenated to this initial prompt to create the full request.

- **API Request**:
  - The API request is constructed in JSON format with a `messages` list, which includes the prompt in the role of a "user."
  - The `stream` is set to `False`, indicating that this request doesn't stream data.
  - A placeholder `function_call` ("get_current_weather") is present but is not used for summarization.

- **API Call**:
  - The `llama.run(api_request_json)` sends the request to the LlamaAPI server, and the response is retrieved and parsed as JSON.

- **Output**:
  - The summarized content is extracted from the response and printed.

## 2. Summarization using T5 Model in Transformers

This method uses Hugging Face's **Transformers** library with the **Falcon** model for summarization.

```python
def summarize_model_t5(text):
    from transformers import pipeline

    summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model="Falconsai/text_summarization")
    summary = summarizer(text, max_length=300, min_length=3)

    return summary
```

### Breakdown:
- **Importing Transformers**: 
  - The `pipeline` method from the `transformers` library is imported.

- **Pipeline Initialization**:
  - The `pipeline` is initialized for the `"summarization"` task using the `"Falconsai/text_summarization"` model, which is a pre-trained model designed for summarizing text.

- **Summarization**:
  - The `summarizer` function processes the input `text`, generating a summary with a maximum length of 300 tokens and a minimum length of 3 tokens.
  
- **Return**: 
  - The resulting summary is returned as the output.

## 3. Summarization using Default Transformers Model

This code uses the default summarization pipeline from **Transformers** without specifying a custom model.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

def summarize(text):
    summarizer = pipeline("summarization")
    summary = summarizer(text, max_length=300, do_sample=False)

    return summary
```

### Breakdown:
- **Pipeline Initialization**:
  - A summarization pipeline is initialized without specifying any custom model, meaning the default pre-trained model from the Hugging Face hub will be used.

- **Summarization**:
  - The `summarizer` function processes the input `text`, generating a summary with a maximum length of 300 tokens. The `do_sample=False` argument disables sampling, ensuring the output is deterministic (i.e., the same summary is generated for the same input every time).

- **Return**:
  - The resulting summary is returned as the output.

## Conclusion

These three summarization methods provide flexible ways to generate summaries:
1. **LlamaAPI**: A custom API-based approach that integrates external services for summarization.
2. **Falcon Model (T5)**: A powerful pre-trained model for summarization.
3. **Default Transformers Model**: A simpler, yet effective, method using Hugging Face's default summarization models.

You can choose any method based on your specific use case and the level of customization or model choice you prefer.
